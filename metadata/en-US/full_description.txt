This app creates a semitransparent overlay of a picture on top of the phone's camera preview.  This allows the phone to be positioned in the same location and orientation as when the original picture was taken.  

Currently I use this app as a quick way to align the antennas for my software defined radios with a fixed point, but there can be other uses as well.  

This app has no ads or in-app purchases and collects no data.
