CameraAlign
-----------

This app creates a semitransparent overlay of a picture on top of the phone's camera preview.
This allows the phone to be positioned in the same location and orientation as when the original picture was taken.

Version 2.0 adds zoom with seekbar to image preview. It will also save the zoom level in EXIF data of images saved with this app. When loading an image with saved EXIF data, set the zoom of the image preview to the saved image.

Version 3.0 adds the capability to pick a color in the camera preview or saved image to be transparent to produce green screen effects.  

Currently I use this app as a quick way to align the antennas for my software defined radios with a fixed point, but there can be other uses as well.

This app has no ads or in-app purchases and collects no data.
